# aplpak

This simple utility uses Jorgen Ibsen's freeware aPLib library to compress
one or more data-files into a single compressed container-file.

aPLib's compressed data stream is simple-and-fast to decompress on 8-bit or
higher processors, and some variant of a container-file format is useful
for game development on all platforms from the 1980's to the current day.
